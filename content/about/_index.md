Somewhere around this brick buildings, along the "Canal du Midi" lies the **ISAE-Supaero** graduate school.  
I am studying **data science & machine learning (ML)** on one side and **research & reinforcement learning (RL)** on the other side.  

I am actively looking for an internship in a research lab, in the field of RL, with prefered directions such as:
- (1) **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Communication**
- (2) **Coordination & Multi-Agent RL (MARL)**
- (3) **Robustness & Safety**.
