This is the config section.

- the entire doc [here](/public/doc/config).  
- the [doftiles](https://github.com/a2n-s/dotfiles) for my Arch setup (\*).  
- my [dmenu rice](https://github.com/a2n-s/dmenu) (\*).  
- all the [dmscripts](https://github.com/a2n-s/dmscripts) I use (\*).  
- my [wallpapers](https://github.com/a2n-s/wallpapers) (\*).  

(\*) means that the field comes from another place. Clicking will redirect you there.
