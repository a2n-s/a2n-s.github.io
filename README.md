# a2n-s.github.io
My personal website.

This work is greatly inspired by the following resources:
- the terminal part of the site: [the repo](https://github.com/Yukuro/hugo-theme-shell)
- the user-friendly part of the site: [the hugo frontend](https://gohugo.io/) and [the theme I use](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/)
- the integration of the above: [the implementation](https://github.com/W0rty/w0rty.github.io) and [the original usable version]( https://w0rty.github.io/)

My personal github portfolio wouldn't have been possible without their work!  
Please have a look at what they did if you are interested in doing the same or simply take this repo as a template for your own usage!
